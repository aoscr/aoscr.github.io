  <h1> My thoughts on the personal ethics in class </h1>
    <p>
      Everyone discussing their personal ethics in this class was really interesting for me. 
      <br> A lot of people attributed some of the ten commandments like “Thou shalt not kill” and “Thou shalt not steal” 
      <br> directly into the foundations of their personal ethical system, yet didn’t quote 
      <br> “Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor”, the commandment associated with be honest to others, 
      <br> despite most people valuing honesty among others as another strong ethical pillar.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also thought it was weird how music or video games weren’t mentioned as much as I thought they would be 
      <br> for a class full of CompSci majors discussing why their ethics are the way they are. 
      <br> I would believe at least the type of video games someone plays would influence their personality and ethics 
      <br> at such an impressionable age, but I myself either do not recognize it in me and my ethical system, 
      <br> or it really isn't that influential in someone’s ethics.
    </p>
    <p>
      In retrospect, I regret not bringing up my ethnic background, as I feel like it is at least an important factor in introducing myself, 
      <br> including my own ethical structure I live day-to-day with. I don't think my ethnic background is that unique, but it 
      <br> is at the very least different than most.
