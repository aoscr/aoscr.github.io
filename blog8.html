  <h1> My Final Thoughts on the Senior Seminar Class </h1>
  <p>
    <br> To be honest, I didn't think I would be as dejected as I am about this class ending, but I will definitely miss it. 
    <br> 
    <br> I think a really important aspect of this class, at least what I enjoyed mostly from it, was the daily discussions of the current events that 
    <br> everyone finds interesting and brings to class, and how important it is to know what is going on and what people are focused and worried about.
    <br> To have your "finger on the pulse" with that other people are interested in will help with everyone getting on the same page with starting put the class discussions.
    <br>
    <br> Another topic I want to highlight for this class is the insights I have for the discussions for case studies and examples of the 
    <br> CompSci world of working, and I wish I had a dedicated notebook for those sections to look back while I am focusing more and more on 
    <br> breaking into the CS job market and keeping those points discussed in class in mind.
    <br>
    <br> The last thing I want to discuss for this class is the importance of putting passion into what you look into for this class. This is the last 
    <br> lecture class I have for my college experience, and in because of that fact its the last branch of freedom I think I can express in my work, and to
    <br> have that drive of passion for what I can talk about in this last class is something I do not take for granted.
    <br>
    <br> Overall ok, would recommend.
