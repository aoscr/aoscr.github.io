  <h1> Welcome to my blog!</h1>

  <p>
    <br> My name is Oscar Verrico, and I am currently a senior in Appalachian State University, currently working towards a Bachelor's in Computer Science. 
    <br> I thought I would make my blog assignment fun by making it a website that i can manipulate all I want, maybe give it a refreshing look every now and then. 
    <br>
    <br> We will wait and see I suppose. :)
