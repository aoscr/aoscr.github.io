  <h1> Welcome to my blog!</h1>

  <p>
    <br> My name is Oscar Verrico, and I am currently a senior in Appalachian State University, currently working towards a Bachelor's in Computer Science. 
    <br> I thought I would make my blog assignment fun by making it a website that i can manipulate all I want, maybe give it a refreshing look every now and then. 
    <br>
    <br> We will wait and see I suppose. :)

  <h3> Best In Class Coding Experience </h3>
  <p> 
    <br> I want to say, the best in class coding experience I had in a class would be trying the bomb defusing lab in Computer Systems II,  \
    <br> and not having to freak out about it as much since my training from Comp Systems I kicked in.

  <h3> Best Out of Class Coding Experience </h3>
  <p> 
    <br> My best out of coding experience was the Appstate hack-a-thon Appalhack, it was my first (and only) hack-a-thon and it was 
    <br> a blast figuring out a completely new concept of trying to get image APIs to fit like jigsaw puzzle pieces with each other.
