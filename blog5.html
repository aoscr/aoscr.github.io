    <h1> My Thoughts After CitizenFour </h1>

    <p>
        <br> While a lot of the information seemed to me at first to be a bit too fearmongering for my taste, reflecting on the gross command they had on 
        <br> almost every US citizen with their surveillance clearance was quite eye opening.  It was something we needed to hear, and I grew up with 
        <br> "The governemt has the power to watch your online presense" but to see the story of the inciting incident of this was really interesting.
        <br> Its also really interesting that we also haven't seen political policy change abut the situation, they got caught and said "Oops, sorry about that guys" 
        <br> and kept on trucking. Its honestly discouraging to see that the government doesn't care to be exposed, yet still seeks out "justice" against Snowden.
