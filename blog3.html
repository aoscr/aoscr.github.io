  <h1> My Thoughts on the Bee Informed Partnership and Hive Tracks Case Study</h1>
    
  <p>
    <br> Something I thought was fasctinating for the case study was covering the extensive history of Hive Tracks. 
    <br> Despite Hive Tracks being a relatively straightforward product, it still had to deal with a drive to develop it further 
    <br> due to competition and legal logistics. The discussion of code ownership and patents scoped the realism in CompSci startup business,
    <br> which gave me a way better understanding and a little smudge of hope for my potential future in CompSci. 
    <br>
    <br> I also enjoyed the discussion with the rise and fall of Bee Informed Partnership, with how it was founded with the goal
    <br> of understanding the steep decline of bee populations during 2006-2007 seasons. Unfortunately it was not a sustainable model in the end
    <br> and had to reduce their operations due to a lack of support through funding, but still served a valuable purpose in the beekeeping world.
    <br> Although not all is lost, as there is groundwork that supports the revitalization of a bootstrapped Bee Informed Partnership.
    <br> 
    <br> T thik what will stick with me the most from this case study is that I wasn't aware how sensitive the basic data that any app can be,
    <br> as the examples of bee hive location and other user data that Hive Tracks would utilize would be catastrophic if that data was compromised. 
    <br> Simple data like location is integral to the production of certain types of honey, and that this data is really representing people's livelihoods.
    <br> It must be ensured to be protected and hidden if the Hive Tracks user needs it to be.
