  <h1> My Experience through Hurricane Helene </h1>
    
  <p>
    <br> I had quite a strange time through all of the craziness of the hurricane. The Wednesday before the storm, 
    <br> I had to go to the emergency room for my acting up back. Luckily I was able to get a prescription for muscle relaxant and pain suppressors, 
    <br> but that means that during the brunt of the storm, I was on a prescribed daze watching the trees ourside my window do the equivalent of "the limbo".
    <br> I did lose both power and cellular connection so all I could really do was light some candles and rest my back, so the lack of technology 
    <br> did not really affect me since I wasn't at will to use technology anyways.
  </p>

  <p>
    <br> The Sunday after the hurricane, I was finally able to go to work and my work miraculously survived with very minimal flooding in the back. 
    <br> Even the internet was fully operational and I was able to contact a ton of people and be able to talk to coworkers about our personal experiences.
    <br> Everyone was sharing their stories and what they were able to film during the hurricane, and it was mind blowing and so surreal seeing places 
    <br> I knew just get ravaged by crazy wind and flooding. Most of the following weeks was a blur of going to work, loading more news and contacting and updating everyone,
    <br> and then going home and doing chores while still taking prescribed pain suppressants for my back. 
    <br> Im just so thankful that my situation was relatively calm.
