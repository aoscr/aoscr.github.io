    <h1> My Thoughts After Privacy Discussions </h1>
    
    
    <p>
      <br> I do not like the current state of the handling of data and pricavy for my day-to-day life. When I try to 
      <br> understand more about the policies I subscribe to with the apps that i use, the more i have to google words 
      <br> I have never heard in context to my identity and data. I also have no alternative to most of the clauses I have to
      <br> look at when signing up for these apps, with a copy of all of my important identifying information belonging to corporations
      <br> thats use my data to engineer and target to influence other aligning "data points" for what they are selling. 
      <br>
      <br> I am not shocked that the information out there readily available for anyone to google search exists hoverver, as I grew up
      <br> with the notion that the internet never forgets. Im surprosed though that not much has been changed with the development of technology
      <br> surrounding the protection of data.
