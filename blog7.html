  <h1> My Thoughts on Final Topic Presentations </h1>
  <p>
    <br> While I havent seen all of the presentations yet, I am most interested in the aspect of 
    <br> AI being used to help mental illness diagnoses. I don't know much about mental illnesses, but imagining an 
    <br> algorithm being able to accurately diagnose them, as an unfeeling machine is crazy to think about to me. 
    <br>
    <br> I also found it curious that it is a way for althorighmic bias to be an issue with another facet of the systems 
    <br> in our lives, as initial training data bias will inaccurately skew the diagnosis results, and since I am doing
    <br> my final topic of algorithmic bias being prevalent everywhere, I think it should be included into my presentation.
